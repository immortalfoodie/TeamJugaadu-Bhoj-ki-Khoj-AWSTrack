## 🎯 What is Bhoj-ki-Khoj?

**Bhoj-ki-Khoj** is a **web-based food delivery platform** that connects users with **home chefs and local food vendors**, inspired by the **Mumbai dabbawala model**.

Unlike mainstream food apps that promote fast food and large restaurants, Bhoj-ki-Khoj focuses on:

* **Healthy, hygienic home-style meals**
* **Empowering small food providers**
* **Low-cost, community-based delivery**

All managed through a **single, scalable digital platform**.
