## 🎯 Project Overview

**Bhoj-ki-Khoj** is an affordable food delivery platform that keeps the ₹50 lunch box at ₹50!

We connect local tiffin services and bhojnalays (small restaurants under ₹100) with customers through Mumbai's iconic dabbawala network - eliminating the price inflation caused by traditional delivery platforms.

### The Problem We Solve
- A ₹50 lunch box becomes ₹150 on Zomato/Swiggy
- Local tiffin services can't afford 20-30% platform fees
- Students and professionals need affordable, home-cooked meals
- Small bhojnalays have no digital presence

### Our Solution
- **Minimal fees**: 5-10% commission (vs 20-30%)
- **Dabbawala delivery**: ₹5-10 per order (vs ₹40-60)
- **Daily fresh menus**: Updated based on what's cooked
- **Local focus**: Tiffin services, bhojnalays, home kitchens

### Key Technologies
- React.js + TypeScript
- Supabase (Database)
- Firebase (Authentication)
- Maps API (Delivery & Tracking)
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

### User Roles
1. **Customer** - Browse, order, and track food
2. **Restaurant/Home Chef** - Manage menu and orders
3. **Dabbawala** - Handle deliveries with route optimization
4. **Admin** - Platform management and analytics
